# HTML5 player for Crunchyroll

[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/YePpHa/crunchyroll-html5/all.svg)](https://github.com/YePpHa/crunchyroll-html5/releases/latest)

We really don't like flash and want it killed ASAP. However, there's currently
no HTML5 player available for Crunchyroll without having a subscription. So this
is the answer.

## Features
- A fully fledged HTML5 player that looks and feels a lot like YouTube's player.
- Video quality based on the selected quality shown under the video.
- Subtitles, we all want subtitles for our weeb shows. Otherwise the majority of
  us won't be able to enjoy our shows.

## Subtitle Engine
The browser is really bad at displaying subtitles so I had to find a library
that's able to render SSA/ASS subtitles. I've looked into just using WebVTT, but
Chrome was not really able to render them without a big black box around them.

So I've decided on using
[JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus](https://github.com/Dador/JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus),
which is an [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) project that
makes [libass](https://github.com/libass/libass) work in the browser with font
support. However, I've been required to make some changes to the project to
allow for dynamically loading the
[default.ttf](https://github.com/YePpHa/crunchyroll-html5/blob/master/vendor/JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus/default.ttf)
file and the
[fonts.conf](https://github.com/YePpHa/crunchyroll-html5/blob/master/vendor/JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus/fonts.conf)
file. I've also implemented a way to change the subtitle track without needing
to restart the WebWorker that's running the engine.

_All modifications can be found [here](https://github.com/YePpHa/JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus)._

## Build
Building this project will result in a `crunchyroll-html5.user.js` file in the
`/dist` directory. To make it run on Crunchyroll you need to prepend a
userscript header that allows for script execution on
`http://www.crunchyroll.com/*`. I've currently not made it able to build for
each browser or userscript.

Before building make sure that you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional). After that you're required to
install the project dependencies through either Yarn.

Building is done by running the script `build`:
```
$ yarn build
```

## Packaging
You can package the legacy Firefox addon as `firefox.xpi` (unsigned as it's not
possible to sign it anymore) and the Web Extension as `webextension.zip`
(signable see below).

```
$ yarn package:firefox
$ yarn package:webextension
```

### Firefox Signing
You're able to sign the Web Extension. However, you need an API key and an API
secret to be able to sign the Web Extension (you can get one
[here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/)).
If you leave the ID of the extension empty a new one will be generated. You can
use the generated ID in the future to update the extension instead of creating
new extensions every update.

```
$ yarn sign:webextension --key <API KEY> --secret <API SECRET> --id <ID>
```

## TODO
- Add support for tracking progress
  - Chrunchyroll
    - Tracking episodes watched
    - Use Crunchyrolls resume feature.
  - Kitsu
    - Tracking episodes watched
  - MyAnimeList
    - Tracking episodes watched
  - Local
    - Tracking episodes watched
    - Tracking what you've watched in a video.
    - Resume videos that you haven't completely watched yet.
  - ...
- Add option to change subtitles to other languages. Currently, only the default
  subtitle is displayed (in most cases this will be English).
- Add more fonts. Currently, only Arial is available. Should be quite easy, but
  some testing needs to be done for this.
- Consider moving the quality selection into the player.
- Look into adding Chromecast support.
- Add an endscreen to indicate the user has finished the currently episode and
  perhaps automatically go to the next episode.
- Add multiple versions of this project for userscripts, Chrome, Firefox and
  more.
- Add a way for the player to remember user choices as how high or low the
  volume is.
- Look into reducing the size of the code in the userscript.
